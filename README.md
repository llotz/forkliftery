## todo short term
- list events correctly (doesn't work)
- subscribe to start_game with real event that switches rendering method (not rendering and updating everything in main.lua hardcoded)

## todo long term
- add fixed objects
- add objects to interact with
- collision detection
- (dynamic acceleration)

## events
start_game - fires when the game starts
